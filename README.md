# ircbot
ircbot.c by trojanman - runs an ircbot with secure msg commands

DISCLAIMER: I am not a coder by trade. I am using basic coding knowledge and the help of AI to generate this project.
All code has been generated by myself or an AI agent to assist with function building. 

I'm open to any suggestions if by chance someone stumbles upon this repository.

How to use:

1) Edit bot.h and modify the default variables in the edit section. This is what the bot will use to start. All later configuration may be modified with bot commands. Please get these variables correct!

2) Run "make"

3) Start ircbot. At this time I recommend using "screen" to house the process in the background. Once a screen is started, run the bot with "./ircbot <config_password>". The config password must be remembered! This is used to encrypt any config changes. You must use the same password each time you start the bot.
* Don't have "screen" or want to execute the bot without?: "./ircbot <config_password> &"

4) To send commands to your bot, you will need to hash your DEFAULT_BOT_PASS that you defined in bot.h. The hash output is timebased and lasts for no more than 120 seconds. I have provided two methods for generating this hash:
* Linux CLI: ./bot-auth.sh <DEFAULT_BOT_PASS> will output a hash you may send to your bot: 
    * /msg botnick <hash_output> help
* IRSSI Script: bot_auth.pl. You may "/script load bot_auth.pl" with bot_auth.pl in ~/.irssi/scripts/. 
    * /set bot_auth_password <DEFAULT_BOT_PASS>
    * /botcmd botnick help
