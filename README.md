# ircbot
ircbot.c by trojanman - runs an ircbot with secure msg commands

DISCLAIMER: I am not a coder by trade. I am using basic coding knowledge and the help of AI to generate this project.
All code has been generated by myself or an AI agent to assist with function building. 

I'm open to any suggestions if by chance someone stumbles upon this repository.


### System Requirements
    * Compiler: gcc (Tested with: GCC 13.3.0)
    * Make: GNU Make (Tested with: GNU Make 4.3)
    * OpenSSL Libs: libssl-dev (Tested with: libssl-dev 3.0.13)   (IE: apt install libssl-dev on Ubuntu)

### How to use:
1) Edit bot.h and modify the default variables in the edit section. This is what the bot will use to start. All later configuration may be modified with bot commands. Please get these variables correct!

2) Run `"make && make install"`
    * "make" creates the binary
    * "make install" cleans the directory of all config and compiler objects.

3) Start ircbot. Choose config password and use run_bot.sh in utils/ to start the bot. 
    * ./run_bot.sh
    * Example crontab line:  */5 * * * * /home/user/ircbot/run_bot.sh 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null

4) To send commands to your bot, you will need to hash your DEFAULT_BOT_PASS that you defined in bot.h. The hash output is timebased and lasts for no more than 120 seconds. I have provided two methods for generating this hash:
* Linux CLI: ./bot-auth.sh <DEFAULT_BOT_PASS> will output a hash you may send to your bot: 
    * /msg botnick <hash_output> help
* IRSSI Script: bot_auth.pl. You may "/script load bot_auth.pl" with bot_auth.pl in ~/.irssi/scripts/ or place in ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/ for automatic loading upon starting irssi. 
    * /set bot_auth_password <DEFAULT_BOT_PASS>
    * /botcmd botnick help

### Changelog

* v1.1.2 - main branch (not packaged until further testing is complete)
    * Enhancement: Change AES-256-CBC implementation over to AES-256-GCM for config file read/write
    * Enhancement: Modified config line values to make more sense as config options have been added
    * Enhancement: Moved AES-256-CBC config tools to legacy utils in the utils/ folder (legacy)
    * Enhancement: Created new config tools (encrypt_config.c/decrypt_config.c) using AES-256-GCM
    * Fix: Makefile now chmods 700 compiled binary
    * Fix: Added g_shutdown_flag to main bot loop to check for ctrl+c signal
    * Fix: Corrected utils/run_bot.sh to show ENV_VAR is customizable and must match bot.h value
